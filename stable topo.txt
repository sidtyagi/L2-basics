Let us assume a 3 switch topology (S1,S2,S3) as shown in stable topo.jpg.
S1 is the root bridge,hence both its ports will be in Designated forwarding state.
S2 receives BPDUs from the root bridge on 0/1 , hence 0/1 will be the root port.
Similarly for S3 0/4 will be the root port.
Under the assumption,S2 sends superior BPDUs , for the link segment L2 we have 0/2 as DP while 0/3 of S3 as ND(Non Designated) port

SOftware related issues:
Suppose due to some reason,the STP process on S2 is crashed.
Initially S3 was receiving BPDUs from S2 on its non-designated port.Now,
even though the link between S2 and S3 is up,still S3 is not receiving the BPDUs.Therefore,S3 will wait for Max age timer,which is 20 sec by default.
Once,the timer expires,S3 will put its non-designated port to designated state and assume forwarding state,thereby triggering a loop scenario.

Link failure between S1 and S2
Let's assume, the link between s1 and S2 fails,the root port is physically down.
In this case,S2 stops receiving BPDUs from the root bridge and immediately considers itself as the root bridge,thereby sending BPDUs towards S3.
Since S3 is still receiving better BPDUs on its root port from S1,it will wait for the max-age timer to expire.In the meantime,it will continue to receive both inferior and superior BPDu.
Once the max age timer expires,S3 transitions its non designated port to designated state and starts sending BPDUs to S2
